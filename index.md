I am a software developer currently working as a Senior Developer at [Techmodal](https://www.techmodal.com/). Previously I was an Integrations Developer and Technical Service Manager at [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/it-services/what-we-do/) where I also completed a BSc in Mathematics.

My technical experience covers all elements of full stack: relational database design and development, data-driven application development, integrations development and front-end development.

I currently enjoy my role building UI-driven web applications in the [Remix](https://remix.run/) framework, mainly on problems in the defense strategic and logistics space. See my [Projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects) page for examples of recent work.
