I am a software developer currently working as a Senior Developer at Techmodal. Previously I was an Integrations Developer and Technical Service Manager at University of Bristol where I also completed a BSc in Mathematics.

My technical experience covers all elements of full stack: relational database design and development, data-driven application development, integrations development and front-end development.

I currently enjoy my role building UI-driven web applications in the Remix stack, mainly on problems in the defense strategic and logistics space. See my [Projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects) page for examples of recent work.
